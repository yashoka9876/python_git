#this code will help you to swap two numbers
# x=15
# y=10
# # To take from the user
# #x=input('Enter value of x:')
# #y=input(Enter value of y:')
# #creat a temporary variable and swap teh values
# temp=x
# x=y
# y=temp
# print("the value of x and y after swaping")
# print(x)
# print(y)

# #another way to swaping
# x=3
# y=53
# x,y=y,x
# print("x= ",x)
# print("y= ",y)

# #this is alzo another way to swap two number
# x=29
# y=32
# x=x+y
# y=x-y
# x=x-y
# print("x is ",x)
# print("y is ",y)

#this is again another way to swap the two number using multiplication
x=29
y=32
x=x*y
y=x/y
x=x/y
print("x is ",x)
print("y is ",y)
